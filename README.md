# SkillUp Node.js Web App â€“ CI/CD with Jenkins 

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project showcases a **manual CI/CD pipeline setup** for a Node.js application using **Jenkins** and **GitHub**. The goal is to demonstrate automation of build and test steps using Jenkins while managing the application code in GitHub.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Node.js
- Git & GitHub
- Jenkins (Pipeline)
- NPM (Node Package Manager))

## ðŸ”„ Pipeline Workflow

1. Code is updated and committed to GitHub.
2. **Manually trigger** Jenkins job from Jenkins dashboard.
3. Jenkins job performs:
   - Cloning the latest code from GitHub
   - Installing dependencies via `npm install`
   - Running unit tests with `npm test`
  

## ðŸ›  Jenkins Configuration

- **Job Type**: Declarative Pipeline
- **SCM**: GitHub repo 
- **Build Trigger**: Manual

âœ… Outcome
Node.js app is built and tested via Jenkins.

Manual pipeline provides flexibility to control execution.

Artifacts or deployment steps can be added later.
